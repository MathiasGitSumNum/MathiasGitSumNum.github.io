### Code Review

A code review is an opening introduction to the current functionality of a project and what the plans are to enhance that project. This is a very integral step to the beginning of a projects work cycle, as it ensures consistency in the development process and the following of best practice standards.

#### All three projects were performed on the same application, that being the Fullstack 'travlr' travel package service that I had created in CS-465

##### It should be noted that due to file size issues relating to github limitations, and how migrating files to this repository can get collectively confusing for anyone else trying to work with the files in the future, they are seperated into their own repositories and are linked in each section below:

### Project 1: Software Engineering and Design

### Project 2: Algorithms and Data Structures

### Project 3: Databases
