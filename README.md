## Final Eportfolio presented for CS-499 Computer Science Capstone at SNHU

### Professional Self-Assessment

The time I have spent towards my Computer Science degree at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) has positively altered my professional goals and values. I have been preparing to become a beneficial addition to a team for an employer to consider. This portfolio serves to show off my abilities in the field, such as planning, organization, and problem solving. This will be described further along with each project description below.

Throughout this course, and several previous ones, I have gained knowledge in several categories. These include understanding how communication with team members and stakeholders are typically conducted, how to make working with other

### Code Review

A code review is an opening introduction to the current functionality of a project and what the plans are to enhance that project. This is a very integral step to the beginning of a projects work cycle, as it ensures consistency in the development process and the following of best practice standards. Although there were some pieces of information I had missed going over in this particular example, I have learned from it and strongly intend to improve from it.
